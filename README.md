## Pewlett Hackard Employee Analysis

# Procedure
In order to execute this analysis, a sql data base was created called employees_db. 
Six tables were created to import data into from six csv files. 
Those original csv files can be found here:
[Permalink to data folder containing csv files](https://github.com/maderamel/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL/data)
The sql file containing both the tables with imported data and queries is called employees.sql and can be accessed here: [Permalink to sql file](https://github.com/maderamel/sql-challenge/blob/960424218e1be750cedde0640964f317179c9654/EmployeeSQL/Employees.sql)

# Data Model
Before querying the data, an Entity Relationship Diagram was created in order to help visualize the connections between the tables. 

![This is a screenshot of the Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/maderamel/sql-challenge/blob/a458d519744206fb4b130cf7ad6a05992de266dc/EmployeeSQL/employee_db_model_pic.png)

A file of the Entity Relationship Diagram can be viewed here: [Permalink to Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/maderamel/sql-challenge/blob/a458d519744206fb4b130cf7ad6a05992de266dc/EmployeeSQL/employee_db_model_pic.png)

# Analysis
Each query was saved as a view so that it could easily be viewed within the sql file. 

Each view was also saved as a csv file which can be accessed here: [Permalink to Output Analysis file](https://github.com/maderamel/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL/Output%20Analysis)

A jupyter notebook view (Queries.ipynb) was also created here: [Permalink to Jupyter Notebook Analysis file](https://github.com/maderamel/sql-challenge/blob/a458d519744206fb4b130cf7ad6a05992de266dc/EmployeeSQL/Output%20Analysis/Queries.ipynb)

Below is a list of the Queries that were executed.
